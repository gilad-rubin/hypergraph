Understand the relevant code for this task\n\n## Task Context\nWrite a test that measures the gap between edge start/end points and the VISIBLE node boundaries (excluding shadows). This test MUST FAIL because edges currently connect to shadow boundaries.\n\n**WHY EXISTING TESTS PASS BUT ARE WRONG:**\nThe existing tests use window.__hypergraphVizDebug.nodes which reports WRAPPER bounds (includes shadow). So tests show 0px gap but that's comparing edge position to wrapper position - both wrong by the same amount!\n\n**This test must:**\n1. Query the INNER DOM element directly (.group.rounded-lg inside node wrapper)\n2. Use element.getBoundingClientRect() to get true visible bounds\n3. Compare edge Y coordinates to these INNER bounds\n4. This will reveal the 6-14px gaps\n\n**Expected failure:** 6-14px gaps where we expect 0px.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Create test in tests/viz/test_edge_shadow_gap.py\n- Use Playwright page.evaluate() to query inner elements directly\n- Get inner element bounds via getBoundingClientRect()\n- Get edge path start/end Y from SVG\n- Assert: edge_start_y == source_inner_bottom (0px tolerance)\n- Assert: edge_end_y == target_inner_top (0px tolerance)\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Run pytest tests/viz/test_edge_shadow_gap.py -v\n2. Verify test FAILS (RED phase)\n3. Verify failure shows gaps like 6px or 14px\n\n## STEP 1: Health Check (MANDATORY)\n\nBefore exploring for this task, verify the app is healthy:\n\n1. **Start dev server** (if not running) and verify it starts successfully\n2. **Run test suite** - Execute existing tests (check CLAUDE.md or package.json for commands)\n3. **Smoke test via dev-browser** - Navigate to the app and verify a core flow works\n   - Use the /dev-browser skill\n   - Pick a completed feature from recent work\n   - Verify it still functions correctly\n\n### If Health Check FAILS\n\nIf ANY of these fail, you CANNOT proceed with this task. Report back to orchestrator:\n\n1. **Identify the cause** - Check git log for recent changes:\n   ```bash\n   git log --oneline -5\n   ```\n   Commits should reference bead IDs (e.g., \"Refs: beads-xxx\")\n\n2. **Document findings** - Add a comment to THIS bead with your investigation\n\n3. **Report to orchestrator** - Do NOT create bug beads or modify epic status yourself.\n   The orchestrator will handle creating bug beads and blocking.\n\n## STEP 2: Task-Specific Exploration\n\nOnce health check passes:\n\n1. **Search for relevant code** - Use Grep/Glob to find related files\n2. **Read key files** - Understand existing patterns and conventions\n3. **Identify change locations** - Where will modifications be needed?\n4. **Note dependencies** - What other code might be affected?\n5. **Document findings** - Add a comment summarizing what you learned\n\n## Output to Orchestrator\n\nAdd a comment to THIS bead with your findings, then report to orchestrator.\n\n**If health checks passed**:\n```\nSTATUS: HEALTHY\nFILES: \u003ckey files that will be modified\u003e\nPATTERNS: \u003cexisting patterns to follow\u003e\nAPPROACH: \u003crecommended implementation approach\u003e\nCONCERNS: \u003cany concerns or questions\u003e\n\nACTION: Close this step and proceed to implement.\n```\n\n**If health checks failed**:\n```\nSTATUS: HEALTH_CHECK_FAILED\nFAILURE: \u003cwhat failed - dev server, tests, smoke test\u003e\nERROR: \u003cerror message or description\u003e\nCAUSE: \u003clikely cause from git log investigation\u003e\nRELATED_EPIC: \u003cbead-id from git log if found, or \"unknown\"\u003e\n\nACTION: You must handle this health check failure:\n1. Check for existing bug beads: `bd list --type=bug --status=open`\n2. If no existing bug covers this, create one:\n   bd --no-daemon mol pour bug-fix --var title=\"Health check failure: \u003cbrief description\u003e\" --var task=\"\u003cdetails from my report above\u003e\" --var related_epic=\"\u003cRELATED_EPIC value\u003e\" --assignee ralph\n3. If RELATED_EPIC is a bead ID, link bug to it: `bd dep add \u003cbug-id\u003e \u003cRELATED_EPIC\u003e`\n4. Block current epic on the bug: `bd dep add \u003cyour-id\u003e \u003cbug-id\u003e`\n5. Move current epic back to open: `bd update \u003cyour-id\u003e --status open`\n6. Close this bearings step: `bd close \u003cthis-step-id\u003e`\n7. Exit - do not continue with other steps\n```\n\n## Capturing Gaps\nIf you discover missing work that's clearly needed (validation, security, integration glue, missing API connections):\n```bash\nbd comments add \u003croot-id\u003e \"[GAP] \u003ctitle\u003e - \u003cdescription with file context\u003e\"\n```\n\n## Capturing Learnings\nIf you encountered something noteworthy:\n- An error you struggled with and how you fixed it\n- A pattern you had to follow that wasn't documented\n- A library/component usage gotcha future agents should know\n- Something that might warrant a skill (e.g., \"always use X when doing Y\")\n\n```bash\nbd comments add \u003croot-id\u003e \"[LEARNING] \u003cdescription\u003e\"\n```\n\nOnly add gaps/learnings for non-obvious issues that would help future agents.\n\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"ralph-subagent-bearings","created_at":"2026-01-22T13:29:31.420401+02:00","updated_at":"2026-01-22T13:34:15.609253+02:00","closed_at":"2026-01-22T13:34:15.609253+02:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"hypergraph-mol-03o","depends_on_id":"hypergraph-mol-6gm","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-22T13:29:31.42249+02:00","created_by":"gilad-rubin"}],"comments":[{"id":2,"issue_id":"hypergraph-mol-03o","author":"gilad-rubin","text":"STATUS: HEALTHY\nFILES:\n- tests/viz/test_visual_layout_issues.py (add new test class)\n- tests/viz/test_edge_connections.py (existing extraction pattern)\n- src/hypergraph/viz/geometry.py (NodeGeometry dataclass)\n- src/hypergraph/viz/assets/app.js (line 980 shows how to query inner bounds)\n- src/hypergraph/viz/CLAUDE.md (documents shadow exclusion pattern)\n\nPATTERNS:\n- Use page fixture from playwright.sync_api\n- Render with visualize(graph, depth=2, output=temp_path, _debug_overlays=True)\n- Wait for window.__hypergraphVizDebug to be ready\n- Use page.evaluate() with JavaScript to query DOM and extract measurements\n\nKEY INSIGHT - WHY EXISTING TESTS PASS BUT ARE WRONG:\n- tests/viz/test_edge_connections.py line 153 extracts nodes from window.__hypergraphVizDebug.nodes\n- This debug data contains WRAPPER bounds (from nodePositionMap in layout)\n- Edge positions are calculated using the SAME wrapper coordinate system\n- So tests show 0px gap because both edge Y and node Y come from same (wrong) source\n\nTHE FIX - QUERY ACTUAL DOM:\n- Query '.react-flow__node' wrapper elements\n- Get inner content via wrapper.querySelector('.group.rounded-lg') || wrapper.firstElementChild\n- Use getBoundingClientRect() on inner element to get VISIBLE bounds (excludes shadow)\n- This is exactly how the centering logic works in app.js line 980-981\n\nAPPROACH:\n1. Create new test class TestVisibleBoundsEdgeGaps in test_visual_layout_issues.py\n2. Extract node bounds by querying INNER DOM elements, not debug data\n3.

This should reveal 6-14px gaps where shadow extends beyond visible node\n\nEXPECTED FAILURE:\n- Edges currently connect to wrapper (shadow) boundaries, not visible node boundaries\n- Shadow extends 6-14px beyond visible node box (.group.rounded-lg)\n- Test will fail showing gaps of approximately 6-14px\n\nCONCERNS:\n- Edge path Y coordinates are in ReactFlow layout space, getBoundingClientRect() returns screen pixels\n- Need to account for viewport transform when comparing\n- Alternatively: use innerBounds - measure distance from edge Y to inner top in the same coordinate space by computing the delta between wrapper bounds and inner bounds\n\nACTION: Close this step and proceed to implement.","created_at":"2026-01-22T11:33:58Z"}]}

Understand the relevant code for this task\n\n## Task Context\nCreate the _build_node_to_parent_map(flat_graph) function in renderer.py. This function should iterate through all nodes in the flat graph and build a mapping from each node ID to its parent container ID. Handle nested containers properly.\n\nTest Steps:\n1. Add _build_node_to_parent_map function in renderer.py\n2. Function iterates through flat_graph nodes\n3. For each node with a parent, adds node_id -\u003e parent_id mapping\n4. Test with workflow graph: clean_text -\u003e preprocess, normalize_text -\u003e preprocess\n5. Test with outer graph: step1 -\u003e inner, inner -\u003e middle\n\n## STEP 1: Health Check (MANDATORY)\n\nBefore exploring for this task, verify the app is healthy:\n\n1. **Start dev server** (if not running) and verify it starts successfully\n2. **Run test suite** - Execute existing tests (check CLAUDE.md or package.json for commands)\n3. **Smoke test via dev-browser** - Navigate to the app and verify a core flow works\n   - Use the /dev-browser skill\n   - Pick a completed feature from recent work\n   - Verify it still functions correctly\n\n### If Health Check FAILS\n\nIf ANY of these fail, you CANNOT proceed with this task. Report back to orchestrator:\n\n1. **Identify the cause** - Check git log for recent changes:\n   ```bash\n   git log --oneline -5\n   ```\n   Commits should reference bead IDs (e.g., \"Refs: beads-xxx\")\n\n2. **Document findings** - Add a comment to THIS bead with your investigation\n\n3. **Report to orchestrator** - Do NOT create bug beads or modify epic status yourself.\n   The orchestrator will handle creating bug beads and blocking.\n\n## STEP 2: Task-Specific Exploration\n\nOnce health check passes:\n\n1. **Search for relevant code** - Use Grep/Glob to find related files\n2. **Read key files** - Understand existing patterns and conventions\n3. **Identify change locations** - Where will modifications be needed?\n4. **Note dependencies** - What other code might be affected?\n5. **Document findings** - Add a comment summarizing what you learned\n\n## Output to Orchestrator\n\nAdd a comment to THIS bead with your findings, then report to orchestrator.\n\n**If health checks passed**:\n```\nSTATUS: HEALTHY\nFILES: \u003ckey files that will be modified\u003e\nPATTERNS: \u003cexisting patterns to follow\u003e\nAPPROACH: \u003crecommended implementation approach\u003e\nCONCERNS: \u003cany concerns or questions\u003e\n\nACTION: Close this step and proceed to implement.\n```\n\n**If health checks failed**:\n```\nSTATUS: HEALTH_CHECK_FAILED\nFAILURE: \u003cwhat failed - dev server, tests, smoke test\u003e\nERROR: \u003cerror message or description\u003e\nCAUSE: \u003clikely cause from git log investigation\u003e\nRELATED_EPIC: \u003cbead-id from git log if found, or \"unknown\"\u003e\n\nACTION: You must handle this health check failure:\n1.

This test MUST FAIL because interactive expand produces broken edge routing.\n\n**The key bug:**\nWhen you click to expand a nested graph, edges should route to INTERNAL nodes (clean_text). Instead, they stay connected to the CONTAINER (preprocess).\n\n**What to compare:**\n1. Edge target IDs - After expanding, edges should target clean_text, not preprocess\n2. Edge source IDs - After expanding, edges should source from normalize, not preprocess\n3. Edge paths (Y coordinates) - Secondary validation\n\n**Evidence:**\nStatic depth=1 (CORRECT): input_text → clean_text\nInteractive expand (BROKEN): input_text → preprocess (wrong target!)\n\n**Steps:**\n- Create test in tests/viz/test_interactive_expand.py\n- Render workflow at depth=0, click expand, capture edge data\n- Render fresh workflow at static depth=1, capture edge data\n- Assert: interactive edge targets == static edge targets\n- Assert: interactive edge sources == static edge sources\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Run pytest tests/viz/test_interactive_expand.py -v\n2. Verify test FAILS (RED phase)\n3. Verify failure shows edge target mismatch\n\n## Automated Checks\n\n1. **Run type checking** - Check CLAUDE.md or package.json for commands (e.g., `bun typecheck`)\n2. **Run tests** - Execute test suite (e.g., `bun test`)\n3. **Run linting** - If available, run the linter\n\n## UI Verification (if applicable)\n\nIf this task involves UI changes, use the /dev-browser skill:\n\n1. Navigate to the affected page\n2. Follow any test steps from the task description\n3. Save screenshots to `.choo-choo-ralph/screenshots/` for verification\n4.

Run test - verify it detects crossing violations if they exist\n\n## STEP 1: Health Check (MANDATORY)\n\nBefore exploring for this task, verify the app is healthy:\n\n1. **Start dev server** (if not running) and verify it starts successfully\n2. **Run test suite** - Execute existing tests (check CLAUDE.md or package.json for commands)\n3. **Smoke test via dev-browser** - Navigate to the app and verify a core flow works\n   - Use the /dev-browser skill\n   - Pick a completed feature from recent work\n   - Verify it still functions correctly\n\n### If Health Check FAILS\n\nIf ANY of these fail, you CANNOT proceed with this task. Report back to orchestrator:\n\n1. **Identify the cause** - Check git log for recent changes:\n   ```bash\n   git log --oneline -5\n   ```\n   Commits should reference bead IDs (e.g., \"Refs: beads-xxx\")\n\n2. **Document findings** - Add a comment to THIS bead with your investigation\n\n3. **Report to orchestrator** - Do NOT create bug beads or modify epic status yourself.\n   The orchestrator will handle creating bug beads and blocking.\n\n## STEP 2: Task-Specific Exploration\n\nOnce health check passes:\n\n1. **Search for relevant code** - Use Grep/Glob to find related files\n2. **Read key files** - Understand existing patterns and conventions\n3. **Identify change locations** - Where will modifications be needed?\n4. **Note dependencies** - What other code might be affected?\n5. **Document findings** - Add a comment summarizing what you learned\n\n## Output to Orchestrator\n\nAdd a comment to THIS bead with your findings, then report to orchestrator.\n\n**If health checks passed**:\n```\nSTATUS: HEALTHY\nFILES: \u003ckey files that will be modified\u003e\nPATTERNS: \u003cexisting patterns to follow\u003e\nAPPROACH: \u003crecommended implementation approach\u003e\nCONCERNS: \u003cany concerns or questions\u003e\n\nACTION: Close this step and proceed to implement.\n```\n\n**If health checks failed**:\n```\nSTATUS: HEALTH_CHECK_FAILED\nFAILURE: \u003cwhat failed - dev server, tests, smoke test\u003e\nERROR: \u003cerror message or description\u003e\nCAUSE: \u003clikely cause from git log investigation\u003e\nRELATED_EPIC: \u003cbead-id from git log if found, or \"unknown\"\u003e\n\nACTION: You must handle this health check failure:\n1.

Instead, they stay connected to the CONTAINER (preprocess).\n\n**What to compare:**\n1. Edge target IDs - After expanding, edges should target clean_text, not preprocess\n2. Edge source IDs - After expanding, edges should source from normalize, not preprocess\n3.

These appear to be a SEPARATE issue from the interactive expand bug.\n\nANALYSIS OF INTERACTIVE EXPAND BUG:\n- Root cause confirmed: When expansion state toggles, edges are NOT re-routed to internal nodes\n- layout.js performRecursiveLayout already has edge re-routing logic (Step 4.5, lines 785-854)\n- The problem: This re-routing only happens during INITIAL layout via performRecursiveLayout\n- app.js onToggleExpand (line 707-741) only changes expansionState - it doesn't trigger edge re-routing\n\nKEY INSIGHT: The edge re-routing logic in layout.js uses routingData (output_to_producer, param_to_consumer) to find actual internal node endpoints. This works for STATIC renders because performRecursiveLayout is called with fresh nodes. But for INTERACTIVE expand, the edges come from stateResult.edges which are NOT re-routed.\n\nFIX APPROACH:\nThe fix needs to happen in layout.js useLayout when expansionState changes:\n1. When a container is expanded, edges TO/FROM that container need actualSource/actualTarget set\n2. The routingData param_to_consumer tells us which internal node consumes each input\n3. The routingData output_to_producer tells us which internal node produces each output\n\nFILES THAT WILL BE MODIFIED:\n- src/hypergraph/viz/assets/layout.js (main fix - add edge re-routing for expanded containers)\n\nPATTERNS TO FOLLOW:\n- layout.js lines 785-854 shows how to re-route edges using routingData\n- Use nodePositions and nodeDimensions maps to get actual node coordinates\n- Set actualSource/actualTarget on edge.data for proper visual routing\n\nCONCERNS:\n- The edge-shadow-gap test failures are separate but related - they test visual positioning.

Add HAS_PLAYWRIGHT check. Define make_workflow() helper that creates the nested graph (preprocess[clean_text, normalize] -\u003e analyze). This test file will verify edges connect to visible node boundaries, not shadow boundaries.\n\nTest steps:\n1. File exists at tests/viz/test_edge_shadow_gap.py\n2.

Verify the codebase is in a healthy state\n2. Understand the relevant code for this task\n\n## Task Context\nWrite a test that compares edge routing between interactive expand and static depth rendering. This test MUST FAIL because interactive expand produces broken edge routing.\n\n**The key bug:**\nWhen you click to expand a nested graph, edges should route to INTERNAL nodes (clean_text). Instead, they stay connected to the CONTAINER (preprocess).\n\n**What to compare:**\n1. Edge target IDs - After expanding, edges should target clean_text, not preprocess\n2. Edge source IDs - After expanding, edges should source from normalize, not preprocess\n3. Edge paths (Y coordinates) - Secondary validation\n\n**Evidence:**\nStatic depth=1 (CORRECT): input_text → clean_text\nInteractive expand (BROKEN): input_text → preprocess (wrong target!)\n\n**Steps:**\n- Create test in tests/viz/test_interactive_expand.py\n- Render workflow at depth=0, click expand, capture edge data\n- Render fresh workflow at static depth=1, capture edge data\n- Assert: interactive edge targets == static edge targets\n- Assert: interactive edge sources == static edge sources\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Run pytest tests/viz/test_interactive_expand.py -v\n2. Verify test FAILS (RED phase)\n3. Verify failure shows edge target mismatch\n\n## STEP 1: Health Check (MANDATORY)\n\nBefore exploring for this task, verify the app is healthy:\n\n1. **Start dev server** (if not running) and verify it starts successfully\n2. **Run test suite** - Execute existing tests (check CLAUDE.md or package.json for commands)\n3. **Smoke test via dev-browser** - Navigate to the app and verify a core flow works\n   - Use the /dev-browser skill\n   - Pick a completed feature from recent work\n   - Verify it still functions correctly\n\n### If Health Check FAILS\n\nIf ANY of these fail, you CANNOT proceed with this task.

Check for:\n   - Visual regressions (layout issues, overflow)\n   - Console errors\n   - White-on-white text or poor contrast\n   - Responsiveness issues\n\n## If Verification FAILS\n\n### Small Fixes (typos, minor issues)\nIf the issue is trivial (typo, missing import, small syntax error):\n1. Fix it directly\n2. Re-run verification\n3. Continue if passes\n\n### Significant Issues (architectural, doesn't meet spec)\nIf the issue requires substantial rework, report back to orchestrator with FAIL status.\nDo NOT reopen the implement step yourself - that's the orchestrator's job.\n\n## Checklist\n- [ ] Types pass\n- [ ] Tests pass (existing + new)\n- [ ] Linting passes\n- [ ] UI verification (if applicable)\n- [ ] Code review looks good\n\n## Output to Orchestrator\n\nAdd a comment to THIS bead with verification results, then report to orchestrator.\n\n**If all checks pass**:\n```\nSTATUS: PASS\nTYPES: pass\nTESTS: pass\nLINT: pass (or N/A)\nUI: pass (or N/A)\nSCREENSHOTS: \u003cpaths if applicable\u003e\n\nACTION: Close this step and proceed to commit.\n```\n\n**If checks fail (significant issues)**:\n```\nSTATUS: FAIL\nTYPES: pass/fail\nTESTS: pass/fail\nLINT: pass/fail\nUI: pass/fail\nISSUE: \u003cwhat's wrong\u003e\nSUGGESTION: \u003cwhat implement should try differently\u003e\n\nACTION: You must handle this verification failure:\n1.

This test MUST FAIL because interactive expand produces broken edge routing.\n\n**The key bug:**\nWhen you click to expand a nested graph, edges should route to INTERNAL nodes (clean_text). Instead, they stay connected to the CONTAINER (preprocess).\n\n**What to compare:**\n1. Edge target IDs - After expanding, edges should target clean_text, not preprocess\n2. Edge source IDs - After expanding, edges should source from normalize, not preprocess\n3. Edge paths (Y coordinates) - Secondary validation\n\n**Evidence:**\nStatic depth=1 (CORRECT): input_text → clean_text\nInteractive expand (BROKEN): input_text → preprocess (wrong target!)\n\n**Steps:**\n- Create test in tests/viz/test_interactive_expand.py\n- Render workflow at depth=0, click expand, capture edge data\n- Render fresh workflow at static depth=1, capture edge data\n- Assert: interactive edge targets == static edge targets\n- Assert: interactive edge sources == static edge sources\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Run pytest tests/viz/test_interactive_expand.py -v\n2. Verify test FAILS (RED phase)\n3. Verify failure shows edge target mismatch\n\n## Execution Loop\n\n1. **Find ready steps**: `bd list --parent \u003cyour-id\u003e --status=open` (Note: use `bd list` not `bd ready` as parent-child deps block `bd ready`)\n2. **For each ready step**, route by assignee prefix:\n   - `ralph-subagent-*`: Spawn a Task agent with the step's description (from `bd show \u003cstep-id\u003e`)\n   - `ralph-inline-*`: Execute the step yourself following its description\n3. **Read what each step reports** and follow its instructions exactly\n4. **Close completed steps**: `bd close \u003cstep-id\u003e`\n5. **Repeat** until no more steps\n\n## Commands\n- Check ready children: `bd list --parent \u003cyour-id\u003e --status=open`\n- View step details: `bd show \u003cstep-id\u003e`\n- Close completed step: `bd close \u003cstep-id\u003e`\n- Add progress note: `bd comments add \u003cstep-id\u003e \"...\"`\n\n## Following Step Instructions\n\nEach step will report back with:\n- A STATUS (e.g., HEALTHY, PASS, FAIL, HEALTH_CHECK_FAILED)\n- Instructions for what you should do next\n\n**You must follow the step's instructions.** Steps may tell you to:\n- Proceed to the next step\n- Reopen a previous step with guidance\n- Create a bug bead and block\n- Mark yourself as blocked\n\nDo exactly what the step tells you. The step knows its domain.\n\n## Completion\n\nWhen all steps are done:\n\n1. **Add summary comment**:\n   ```bash\n   bd comments add \u003cyour-id\u003e \"[summary] Completed: \u003cbrief description\u003e\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for [GAP] comments** on yourself:\n   - Run `bd comments \u003cyour-id\u003e` and look for `[GAP]` entries\n   - If any exist AND no gap-review step ran, add label: `bd label add \u003cyour-id\u003e gaps`\n\n3. **Check for [LEARNING] comments** on yourself:\n   - Look for `[LEARNING]` entries in your comments\n   - If any exist AND no learning-capture step ran, add label: `bd label add \u003cyour-id\u003e learnings`\n\n4. **Close yourself**: `bd close \u003cyour-id\u003e`\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Complete this entire molecule (all applicable steps), then exit.

Verify no unwanted console.log output\n\n## Automated Checks\n\n1. **Run type checking** - Check CLAUDE.md or package.json for commands (e.g., `bun typecheck`)\n2. **Run tests** - Execute test suite (e.g., `bun test`)\n3. **Run linting** - If available, run the linter\n\n## UI Verification (if applicable)\n\nIf this task involves UI changes, use the /dev-browser skill:\n\n1. Navigate to the affected page\n2. Follow any test steps from the task description\n3. Save screenshots to `.choo-choo-ralph/screenshots/` for verification\n4.

{"id":"hypergraph-mol-xue","title":"Implement RED: Write Failing Test for Edge-to-Shadow Gap","description":"# IMPLEMENTATION PHASE\n\n## Goal\nMake the code changes to implement the feature/fix.\n\n## Task Context\nWrite a test that measures the gap between edge start/end points and the VISIBLE node boundaries (excluding shadows). This test MUST FAIL because edges currently connect to shadow boundaries.\n\n**WHY EXISTING TESTS PASS BUT ARE WRONG:**\nThe existing tests use window.__hypergraphVizDebug.nodes which reports WRAPPER bounds (includes shadow). So tests show 0px gap but that's comparing edge position to wrapper position - both wrong by the same amount!\n\n**This test must:**\n1. Query the INNER DOM element directly (.group.rounded-lg inside node wrapper)\n2. Use element.getBoundingClientRect() to get true visible bounds\n3. Compare edge Y coordinates to these INNER bounds\n4. This will reveal the 6-14px gaps\n\n**Expected failure:** 6-14px gaps where we expect 0px.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Create test in tests/viz/test_edge_shadow_gap.py\n- Use Playwright page.evaluate() to query inner elements directly\n- Get inner element bounds via getBoundingClientRect()\n- Get edge path start/end Y from SVG\n- Assert: edge_start_y == source_inner_bottom (0px tolerance)\n- Assert: edge_end_y == target_inner_top (0px tolerance)\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Run pytest tests/viz/test_edge_shadow_gap.py -v\n2. Verify test FAILS (RED phase)\n3.
