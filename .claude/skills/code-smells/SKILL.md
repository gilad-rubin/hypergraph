Your goal is to go over a subset (or all) of the codebase and find code smells and issues in the design of the library.
Come up with a markdown file that surfaces these issues with a short explanation about why they're not recommended and what is.

Use the quality-criteria checklist (loaded via `skills: [quality-criteria]`) as your reference for code smells, design principles, SOLID violations, and flat-code rules.

For each finding, cite the specific smell or principle from the checklist, explain why it applies to this code, and suggest a concrete fix.
