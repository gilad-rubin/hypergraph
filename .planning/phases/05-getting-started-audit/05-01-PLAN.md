<objective>
Audit and polish getting-started.md to be accurate, progressive, and teach strict_types.

Purpose: Documentation is the first experience users have with hypergraph. A polished getting-started guide helps users understand the type validation system that is the library's core value.

Output: Updated getting-started.md that:
1. Has all examples verified against current API
2. Progresses from simple → binding → composition → type validation
3. Demonstrates strict_types with working code
4. Uses step-by-step, human-centered language

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit and fix all code examples</name>
  <files>docs/getting-started.md</files>
  <action>
    Create a test script that extracts and runs every code example from getting-started.md.

    For each example:
    1. Extract the Python code block
    2. Run it with `uv run python -c "..."`
    3. Verify it produces expected output (or at least runs without error)
    4. Fix any examples that fail against current API

    Common issues to check:
    - Import paths (use `from hypergraph import node, Graph, FunctionNode`)
    - API changes since docs were written
    - Missing mock objects (model, db, httpx, openai) - these should be noted as requiring external deps

    Mark examples that require external dependencies with a note rather than trying to make them runnable.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Create scripts/verify_docs.py that:
    1. Extracts code blocks from getting-started.md
    2. Runs each that doesn't have "# Requires:" comment
    3. Reports pass/fail for each
    Run: `uv run python scripts/verify_docs.py`
  </verify>
  <done>All standalone examples pass verification script. External-dep examples are clearly marked.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Add Graph and strict_types section</name>
  <files>docs/getting-started.md</files>
  <action>
    The current guide covers @node decorator but NOT Graph class or strict_types.

    Add a new section after "Working with Nodes" titled "Building Graphs":

    1. **Basic Graph Construction**
       - Show `from hypergraph import Graph`
       - Create 2-3 nodes that connect via parameter names
       - Construct Graph([node1, node2, node3])
       - Show how edges are automatically inferred

    2. **Type Validation with strict_types**
       - Explain the core value: catch type errors at construction time
       - Show example with `strict_types=True`
       - Demonstrate compatible types passing
       - Demonstrate type mismatch failing with clear error
       - Show Union type compatibility
       - Explain when to use strict_types (production code, complex graphs)

    3. **Error Messages**
       - Show what happens with missing annotations
       - Show what happens with type mismatch
       - Show the "How to fix" guidance in error messages

    Use real working examples from tests/test_graph.py as reference.
    Keep language beginner-friendly and step-by-step.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Section "Building Graphs" exists in docs/getting-started.md
    2. "strict_types" appears with working examples
    3. Run the verification script on new examples
  </verify>
  <done>getting-started.md includes Graph construction and strict_types with working examples</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify progressive structure and polish language</name>
  <files>docs/getting-started.md</files>
  <action>
    Review the full document for progressive complexity:

    Ideal order:
    1. Core Concepts (nodes, outputs=state) - exists
    2. Creating Your First Node (simple function) - exists
    3. Working with Nodes (renaming, chaining) - exists
    4. Building Graphs (NEW - composition) - added in Task 2
    5. Type Validation (NEW - strict_types) - added in Task 2
    6. Execution Modes (async, generators) - exists
    7. Function Node Properties (reference) - exists
    8. Common Patterns (advanced) - exists

    Adjustments:
    - Move "Execution Modes" after graphs section (it's more advanced)
    - Move "Function Node Properties" to be reference-style at end
    - Ensure each section builds on previous

    Polish language:
    - Use "you" to address the reader directly
    - Add transitional sentences between sections
    - Ensure each code example has explanation before AND after
    - Remove any jargon without explanation
  </action>
  <verify>
    Read through docs/getting-started.md and verify:
    1. Sections flow from simple to complex
    2. Each code block has context before and explanation after
    3. No unexplained jargon
  </verify>
  <done>Document structure is progressive and language is beginner-friendly</done>
</task>
