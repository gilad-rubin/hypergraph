# Checkpointer

**The interface for workflow persistence and state management.**

Checkpointers store workflow state to enable resume, crash recovery, and multi-turn conversations. Unlike EventProcessor (which handles observability), Checkpointer is a bidirectional interface for reading and writing durable state.

---

## Overview

### Design Principles

1. **Steps are the source of truth** - State is computed from steps, not stored separately
2. **Bidirectional interface** - Both read (load) and write (save) operations
3. **Full persistence** - All outputs are stored when checkpointer is present
4. **Separate from observability** - Checkpointer is not an EventProcessor (see [Why](#why-checkpointer-is-separate))

### Architecture

```
Runner
  │
  ├── Events ──► EventProcessor (observability, write-only)
  │
  └── Steps ──► Checkpointer (durability, read + write)
                  │
                  ├── save_step()      Write
                  ├── get_state()      Read (computed)
                  ├── get_history()    Read
                  └── get_workflow()   Read
```

## Checkpointer Interface

### Base Class

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any

class Checkpointer(ABC):
    """
    Base class for workflow persistence.

    Implementations store workflow steps and provide state retrieval.
    Steps are the source of truth; state is computed from steps.
    """

    # === Write Operations ===

    @abstractmethod
    async def save_step(self, record: StepRecord) -> None:
        """
        Save a step atomically.

        Called by the runner after each node completes. The entire record
        is persisted in a single atomic operation - either all data is
        saved, or nothing. This prevents corrupted state from crashes.

        Implementations should use:
        - Database transactions for SQL backends
        - Atomic document writes for document stores
        - Upsert semantics with unique constraint on (workflow_id, superstep, node_name)

        pass
```

### SyncRunner: No Checkpointer (Use Cache Instead)

**SyncRunner does not support checkpointing.** This is by design:

- SyncRunner is for simple blocking scripts
- No workflow identity or step history needed
- No HITL (InterruptNode requires async)

**For long-running sync DAGs, use cache as "poor man's durability":**

```python
from hypergraph import SyncRunner, DiskCache

runner = SyncRunner(cache=DiskCache("./cache"))

# First run — all nodes execute, results cached
result = runner.run(graph, inputs={"data": big_file})
# 💥 CRASH at node 5

# Restart with same inputs — nodes 1-4 cache hit, only 5+ execute
result = runner.run(graph, inputs={"data": big_file})
```

**When cache is enough:**
- DAGs only (no cycles — cache key changes each iteration)
- Same inputs on restart
- Don't need workflow identity or status queries
- No human-in-the-loop

**When you need checkpointer:**
- Cycles, HITL, or different inputs on resume → use AsyncRunner + Checkpointer

See [Durable Execution](durable-execution.md#syncrunner-cache-based-durability) for the full pattern.

## Why Checkpointer Is Separate

Checkpointer is **not** an EventProcessor. This is deliberate:

| Concern | EventProcessor | Checkpointer |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Direction** | Write-only (push) | Read + Write (bidirectional) |
| **Data** | All events | All outputs |
| **Purpose** | Observability | Durability |
| **Failure mode** | Fire-and-forget | Must succeed |

**The read path doesn't fit the event model.** When resuming a workflow, the runner needs to *query* for existing state. Events are write-only; they flow from runner to consumers.

**Configuration is different.** Streaming recovery modes, serialization, and storage backends are checkpointer concerns, not observability concerns.

See [Observability](observability.md) for EventProcessor details.

---

## State vs Steps

### Steps Are the Source of Truth

**State is computed from StepRecords, not stored separately.**

```
StepRecords (stored atomically):
  Superstep 0: embed, validate (parallel)  → values={"embedding": [...], "valid": true}
  Superstep 1: retrieve                    → values={"docs": [...]}
  Superstep 2: generate                    → values={"answer": "..."}

State (computed by folding values):
  get_state(superstep=2) → {"embedding": [...], "valid": true, "docs": [...], "answer": "..."}
```

### What Gets Saved

**Everything is saved atomically.** Each StepRecord contains both metadata and outputs in a single write.

| Field | Contains |
|-------|----------|
| workflow_id, superstep, node_name, index | Identity |
| status | Execution status |
| input_versions | For staleness detection |
| values | Output values |

This ensures full crash recovery — on resume, completed nodes are skipped, incomplete nodes re-run. Because metadata and values are in one atomic write, there's no possibility of corrupted state from crashes.

### Implications

- **Single source of truth**: Steps are authoritative; state is derived
- **Time travel**: Get state at any historical point
- **No sync issues**: State can never be "out of sync" with steps
- **Full durability**: All nodes are recoverable on crash
- **Atomic writes**: No partial state from crashes between writes

### When to Use Each

| Operation | API | Use Case |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| Continue conversation | `get_state()` | Need accumulated values |
| Debug execution | `get_steps()` | Need step-by-step trail |
| Fork workflow | Both | Need state + steps up to a point |

## Built-in Implementations

### SqliteCheckpointer

```python
from hypergraph.checkpointers import SqliteCheckpointer

checkpointer = SqliteCheckpointer(
    path="./workflows.db",      # Database file path
    # serializer=JsonSerializer(),  # Optional custom serializer
)

runner = AsyncRunner(checkpointer=checkpointer)

## Implementing a Custom Checkpointer

### Minimal Implementation

```python
from hypergraph.checkpointers import Checkpointer
from hypergraph.types import StepRecord, Workflow, WorkflowStatus

class RedisCheckpointer(Checkpointer):
    """Example Redis-based checkpointer."""

    def __init__(self, redis_url: str):
        self.redis_url = redis_url
        self.client = None

    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        import redis.asyncio as redis
        self.client = await redis.from_url(self.redis_url)

    async def close(self) -> None:
        if self.client:
            await self.client.close()

    async def save_step(self, record: StepRecord) -> None:
        """Save step atomically - single write contains all data."""
        key = f"workflow:{record.workflow_id}:step:{record.index}"
        await self.client.hset(key, mapping={
            "superstep": record.superstep,
            "node_name": record.node_name,
            "status": record.status.value,
            "input_versions": json.dumps(record.input_versions),
            "values": json.dumps(record.values),
        })
        # Update step count
        await self.client.hset(
            f"workflow:{record.workflow_id}",
            "step_count",
            record.index + 1
        )

    async def get_state(
        self,
        workflow_id: str,
        superstep: int | None = None,
    ) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # Fold over steps to compute state
        steps = await self.get_steps(workflow_id, superstep=superstep)
        state = {}
        for step in sorted(steps, key=lambda s: s.index):
            if step.values:
                state.update(step.values)
        return state

    async def get_steps(
        self,
        workflow_id: str,
        superstep: int | None = None,
    ) -> list[StepRecord]:
        # Implementation details...
        pass

    # ... other methods
```

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **save_step() is atomic** - Single write per step, all data together
2. **get_state() folds over steps** - Compute state, don't store separately
3. **Handle serialization** - Outputs can be complex objects
4. **Initialize/close for resource management** - Connections, pools, etc.

---

## Serialization

### Default: JSON

By default, outputs are serialized as JSON. This works for most cases:

```python
checkpointer = SqliteCheckpointer("./workflows.db")
# Uses JsonSerializer by default
```

### Custom Serializers

For complex objects (numpy arrays, custom classes), provide a custom serializer:

```python
from hypergraph.checkpointers import Serializer
import pickle

class PickleSerializer(Serializer):
    def serialize(self, value: Any) -> bytes:
        return pickle.dumps(value)

    def deserialize(self, data: bytes) -> Any:
        return pickle.loads(data)

checkpointer = SqliteCheckpointer(
    path="./workflows.db",
    serializer=PickleSerializer(),
)
```

### Serializer Interface

```python
class Serializer(ABC):
    """Base class for output serialization."""

    @abstractmethod
    def serialize(self, value: Any) -> bytes:
        """Convert value to bytes for storage."""
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def deserialize(self, data: bytes) -> Any:
        """Convert bytes back to value."""
        ...
```

---

## Usage with Runner

### Basic Usage

```python
from hypergraph import Graph, node, AsyncRunner
from hypergraph.checkpointers import SqliteCheckpointer

@node(output_name="answer")
async def generate(query: str) -> str:
    return await llm.generate(query)

graph = Graph(nodes=[generate])
runner = AsyncRunner(checkpointer=SqliteCheckpointer("./workflows.db"))

# Run with workflow_id for persistence
result = await runner.run(
    graph,
    values={"query": "What is RAG?"},
    workflow_id="session-123",
)
```

### Execution Is Simple

The runner has one behavior: **load → merge → execute → append**.

```python
# First run
result = await runner.run(graph, values={...}, workflow_id="session-123")
# 💥 CRASH

# Resume - just run with same workflow_id
result = await runner.run(graph, values={...}, workflow_id="session-123")
# State loaded, merged with values, graph executes, steps appended

# Continue conversation - same pattern
result = await runner.run(graph, values={"user_input": "more"}, workflow_id="session-123")
# No special handling - just load, merge, execute, append
```

No state machine. No special cases. History is append-only.

See [Execution Semantics](persistence.md#execution-semantics) for full details.

---

## Nested Workflows

For nested graphs, workflow IDs use path convention:

```python
outer = Graph(nodes=[preprocess, rag.as_node(name="rag"), postprocess])

result = await runner.run(outer, values={...}, workflow_id="order-123")

# Workflow IDs:
# Parent: "order-123"
# Child:  "order-123/rag"
```

### Accessing Nested State

```python
# Get parent state
state = await checkpointer.get_state("order-123")

# Get nested graph state
rag_state = await checkpointer.get_state("order-123/rag")
```

---

## API Reference

### Types

> **Full definitions:** See [Execution Types](execution-types.md#persistence-types) for complete type definitions with docstrings.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class StepRecord:
    """Single atomic record - metadata + values together."""
    workflow_id: str                # Which workflow
    superstep: int                  # Which superstep (batch) - user-facing
    node_name: str                  # Name of the node that executed
    index: int                      # Unique sequential ID (internal, for DB key)
    status: StepStatus              # COMPLETED, FAILED, PAUSED, STOPPED
    input_versions: dict[str, int]  # Versions consumed (for staleness detection)
    values: dict[str, Any] | None   # Node output values
    error: str | None
    pause: PauseInfo | None         # Set when step is paused at InterruptNode
    partial: bool = False           # True if streaming output was truncated by stop
    created_at: datetime
    completed_at: datetime | None
    child_workflow_id: str | None   # For nested graphs

class StepStatus(Enum):
    COMPLETED = "completed"  # Finished with usable output
    FAILED = "failed"        # Terminated with error
    PAUSED = "paused"        # At InterruptNode, waiting for response
    STOPPED = "stopped"      # User stopped, no usable output

@dataclass
class Workflow:
    id: str
    status: WorkflowStatus
    steps: list[StepRecord]         # Unified metadata + values
    graph_hash: str | None          # For version mismatch detection
    created_at: datetime
    completed_at: datetime | None

class WorkflowStatus(Enum):
    ACTIVE = "active"        # Can be resumed (running, paused, or stopped)
    COMPLETED = "completed"  # Terminal success
    FAILED = "failed"        # Terminal failure

@dataclass
class Checkpoint:
    """A point-in-time snapshot for forking workflows."""
    values: dict[str, Any]      # Computed state at this point
    steps: list[StepRecord]     # Step history (the implicit cursor)
```

### Pause Persistence

When an `InterruptNode` executes and waits for a response, the step is saved with:
- `StepStatus.PAUSED` - indicates the step is blocked
- `StepRecord.pause` - contains `PauseInfo` with reason, node, response_param, and value

This enables external systems to query "what is this workflow waiting for?" even after a crash:

```python
# Get workflow to find paused step
workflow = await checkpointer.get_workflow("session-123")

for step in workflow.steps:
    if step.status == StepStatus.PAUSED and step.pause:
        print(f"Waiting for: {step.pause.response_param}")
        print(f"Value to show user: {step.pause.value}")
```

### DBOS Compatibility

These types map to DBOS tables for compatibility:

| hypergraph Type | DBOS Table |
|-----------------|------------|
| `Workflow` | `dbos.workflow_status` |
| `StepRecord` | `dbos.operation_outputs` |

For status mapping between hypergraph and DBOS, see [DBOS Mapping](execution-types.md#dbos-mapping).
